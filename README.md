# 3D Sound Pillards Web  - Vue.js, Three.js, and Blender

This project follows along with an online course, aiming to create a dynamic 3D web experience utilizing Vue.js, Three.js, and Blender.

## Overview

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the integration of frontend JavaScript frameworks with 3D graphics, allowing users to interact with 3D models directly in the browser.

## Tech Stack

* **Vue.js**: Used for the frontend application structure, reactive UI, and state management.
* **Three.js**: Enables rendering and interaction with 3D models directly in web browsers.
* **Blender**: Used for modeling, texturing, and exporting custom 3D objects.

## Features

* Interactive 3D models rendered directly in the browser
* Smooth animations and transitions
* User-friendly UI integration

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:imanirvansyah/sound-pillards-3d-web.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sound-pillards-3d-web

   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Run the project locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your project will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (default Vue.js port).

## Blender Workflow

* Model your objects in Blender.
* Export the models in `.glb` or `.gltf` formats for optimal web performance.
* Place exported models in the appropriate assets directory.
